## Exercise 1 - done with the lecturer

> ### Setup
> Modify `gulpfile.js` so that the `entryPath` variable points to:
> -  `07_Day_4/01_Elastic_media/01_Exercise_1`
>
> **Remember that after each change in `gulpfile.js` you should stop Gulp (`CTRL+C`) and run it again (`gulp`).**

In `index.html` you will find a section with `images` class. Insert an image into it (rabbit.png) in the two following ways:
* using an **img** tag,
* as a background for a **div** element.

Do it in such a way that on a computer screen both images are displayed side by side and each has **50%** of screen width. On a tablet screen one image should be displayed under the other (each having **100%** of screen width).
Use your knowledge and set the styles in such a way that both images are scaled when the browser window is shrunk.


## Exercise 2

> ### Setup
> Modify `gulpfile.js` so that the `entryPath` variable points to:
> -  `07_Day_4/01_Elastic_media/02_Exercise_2`
>
> **Remember that after each change in `gulpfile.js` you should stop Gulp (`CTRL+C`) and run it again (`gulp`).**

In `index.html` you will find a section with `one-image` class. Set its width, height and border. Next, insert rabbit.png in it using the `img` tag so that it takes 100% of the parent element. Can you see any problems? Write them in a comment in the HTML file.


## Exercise 3

> ### Setup
> Modify `gulpfile.js` so that the `entryPath` variable points to:
> -  `07_Day_4/01_Elastic_media/03_Exercise_3`
>
> **Remember that after each change in `gulpfile.js` you should stop Gulp (`CTRL+C`) and run it again (`gulp`).**

In `index.html` you will find a section with `one-image-bg` class. Set its width, height and border. Next, insert rabbit.png in it using CSS - `background-image` in a way that it takes 50% of the parent element.
