## Exercise 1 - done with the lecturer

> ### Setup
> Modify `gulpfile.js` so that the `entryPath` variable points to:
> -  `03_Day_2/05_Introduction_to_RWD_and_units/01_Exercise_1`
>
> **Remember that after each change in `gulpfile.js` you should stop Gulp (`CTRL+C`) and run it again (`gulp`).**

In `index.html` you will find a section named `test`. Test how `px`, `rem`, `em` and `%` units work, setting font size for individual elements.


## Exercise 2

> ### Setup
> Modify `gulpfile.js` so that the `entryPath` variable points to:
> -  `03_Day_2/05_Introduction_to_RWD_and_units/02_Exercise_2`
>
> **Remember that after each change in `gulpfile.js` you should stop Gulp (`CTRL+C`) and run it again (`gulp`).**

In `index.html` you will find a section named `panel` with a paragraph filled with text.
Set font size for the section to 40px, and make the font of the paragraph half the size of the section font size.
Use em unit.


## Exercise 3

> ### Setup
> Modify `gulpfile.js` so that the `entryPath` variable points to:
> -  `03_Day_2/05_Introduction_to_RWD_and_units/03_Exercise_3`
>
> **Remember that after each change in `gulpfile.js` you should stop Gulp (`CTRL+C`) and run it again (`gulp`).**

In `index.html` you will find a section with `bg_box` class that contains a `div` with `box` class.
Set the font size of the `box` to `2em`. Set its width (also using `em`) in such a way that the calculated `width` equals `60px`.


## Exercise 4

> ### Setup
> Modify `gulpfile.js` so that the `entryPath` variable points to:
> -  `03_Day_2/05_Introduction_to_RWD_and_units/04_Exercise_4`
>
> **Remember that after each change in `gulpfile.js` you should stop Gulp (`CTRL+C`) and run it again (`gulp`).**

In `index.html` you will find a section with `container` class with a paragraph element in it.
Set font size of the paragraph to `3rem` in such a way that it equals `24px`.


## Exercise 5

> ### Setup
> Modify `gulpfile.js` so that the `entryPath` variable points to:
> -  `03_Day_2/05_Introduction_to_RWD_and_units/05_Exercise_5`
>
> **Remember that after each change in `gulpfile.js` you should stop Gulp (`CTRL+C`) and run it again (`gulp`).**

In `index.html` you will find a section with `container` class that contains an element with `footer-text` class.
Set the border and width of this element in such a way that the calculated width equals `240px`. Use `rem` units.


## Exercise 6

> ### Setup
> Modify `gulpfile.js` so that the `entryPath` variable points to:
> -  `03_Day_2/05_Introduction_to_RWD_and_units/06_Exercise_6`
>
> **Remember that after each change in `gulpfile.js` you should stop Gulp (`CTRL+C`) and run it again (`gulp`).**

In `index.html` you will find a section with `winnie_the_pooh` class containing a `blockquote` element.
Set the font size of this element to `300%` in such a way that the calculated size equals 30px.


## Exercise 7

> ### Setup
> Modify `gulpfile.js` so that the `entryPath` variable points to:
> -  `03_Day_2/05_Introduction_to_RWD_and_units/07_Exercise_7`
>
> **Remember that after each change in `gulpfile.js` you should stop Gulp (`CTRL+C`) and run it again (`gulp`).**


In `index.html` you will find a section with `images` class containing an element with `img_one` class.
Using `background-image`, set a background for the `img_one` element. (You will find cat.jpg image in the images directory).
Set the width of the whole section to 80%, and border so that the borders of this element are visible.
The element with the image should take `30%` of this section.

Put the width of the section with `images` class in a comment. What is the width of the element with the image now?
Write your observations in a comment.


## Exercise 8

> ### Setup
> Modify `gulpfile.js` so that the `entryPath` variable points to:
> -  `03_Day_2/05_Introduction_to_RWD_and_units/08_Exercise_8`
>
> **Remember that after each change in `gulpfile.js` you should stop Gulp (`CTRL+C`) and run it again (`gulp`).**

In `index.html` you will find a section with `test_height_grandpa` class with nested `div` elements.
Set borders in different colors for all the elements. Next, set '50px' height for the element with `test_height_grandpa` class, and a height twice as big for the `test_height_daddy` element.
Use the percentage unit.

The element with `test_height_baby` class should have the same height as the element with `test_height_grandpa` class - use the percentage units.

### Additional

Put the height of the element with `test_height_daddy` class in a comment. Write your observations in a comment.


## Exercise 9

> ### Setup
> Modify `gulpfile.js` so that the `entryPath` variable points to:
> -  `03_Day_2/05_Introduction_to_RWD_and_units/09_Exercise_9`
>
> **Remember that after each change in `gulpfile.js` you should stop Gulp (`CTRL+C`) and run it again (`gulp`).**

In `index.html` you will find a `h1` element in the section with `centered_text` class.
Using viewport units, place the `h1` element in the center (both vertically and horizontally).
