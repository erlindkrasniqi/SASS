## Exercise 1 - done with the lecturer

> ### Setup
> Modify `gulpfile.js` so that the `entryPath` variable points to:
> -  `03_Day_2/04_Functions/01_Exercise_1`
>
> **Remember that after each change in `gulpfile.js` you should stop Gulp (`CTRL+C`) and run it again (`gulp`).**

Create a variable and assign red color lightened by 40% to it.

Use: [https://sass-lang.com/documentation/modules/color#scale](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/modules/color#scale).


## Exercise 2 - done with the lecturer

> ### Setup
> Modify `gulpfile.js` so that the `entryPath` variable points to:
> -  `03_Day_2/04_Functions/02_Exercise_2`
>
> **Remember that after each change in `gulpfile.js` you should stop Gulp (`CTRL+C`) and run it again (`gulp`).**

Set header colors in such a way that each subsequent header is lighter than the previous one by **15%**.


## Exercise 3

> ### Setup
> Modify `gulpfile.js` so that the `entryPath` variable points to:
> -  `03_Day_2/04_Functions/03_Exercise_3`
>
> **Remember that after each change in `gulpfile.js` you should stop Gulp (`CTRL+C`) and run it again (`gulp`).**

Create a variable and assign any number to it. Next, change the number into percentage using an appropriate function.
Set the result as font size in the paragraph that can be found in the `index.html` file.

Use: [https://sass-lang.com/documentation/modules/math](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/modules/math).


## Exercise 4

> ### Setup
> Modify `gulpfile.js` so that the `entryPath` variable points to:
> -  `03_Day_2/04_Functions/04_Exercise_4`
>
> **Remember that after each change in `gulpfile.js` you should stop Gulp (`CTRL+C`) and run it again (`gulp`).**

Create two variables and assign colors of your choice to them. Using an appropriate function, return the color created by mixing those two previous colors. Use it as background of the `content` section.

Use: [https://sass-lang.com/documentation/modules/color](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/modules/color).


## Exercise 5

> ### Setup
> Modify `gulpfile.js` so that the `entryPath` variable points to:
> -  `03_Day_2/04_Functions/05_Exercise_5`
>
> **Remember that after each change in `gulpfile.js` you should stop Gulp (`CTRL+C`) and run it again (`gulp`).**

Create a function that will return the sum of two numbers passed to it as```number1``` and ```number2```. Use the sum as `padding` of the `article` element.
