# Homework

> ### Setup
> Modify `gulpfile.js` so that the `entryPath` variable points to:
> -  `06_Day_3_-_Homework/01_Mobile_First`
>
> **Remember that after each change in `gulpfile.js` you should stop Gulp (`CTRL+C`) and run it again (`gulp`).**

In `index.html` you will find a section named `blocks`.
Create 5 `div` elements with `block` class within it and set the following properties for each of them:
* width: `25%`
* height: `100vh`
* border: `1px solid red`
* align them side by side (if you have any problems doing it, remember the box-model)

Next:
* on screens narrower than `450px` align the elements one under another and hide the last one,
* on screens wider than `450px` and narrower than `720px` align the elements side by side, show the last one and hide the first one,
* on screens wider than `720px` but narrower than `1024px` show only the last and the first element.

Use the **Mobile first** approach.


# Homework - Flexbox Holy Grail

> ### Setup

> **Remember that after each change in `gulpfile.js` you should stop Gulp (`CTRL+C`) and run it again (`gulp`).**

In `index.html` you will find a section named `holy-grail`.
Using flexbox, create a page template based on the layout you see below:
