## Exercise 1 - done with the lecturer

> ### Setup
> Modify `gulpfile.js` so that the `entryPath` variable points to:
> -  `01_Day_1/01_Sass_basics/01_First_steps_in_SCSS`
>
> **Remember that after each change in `gulpfile.js` you should stop Gulp (`CTRL+C`) and run it again (`gulp`).**

* In `index.html` file add a `h1` with text, e.g. â€žHello, Sassy!" and open the file in the browser.
* Create a directory named `scss`, and create a `main.scss` file in it. The file should contain a header color and a background color for the entire page. The header should be readable.
* Load the generated style sheet in `index.html` (with an appropriate extension).
* Compile the Sass file in a way that you know (e.g. using Gulp).
* Check if an appropriate catalog with the `css` file was generated.
* Refresh the page in the browser.
* Change the header color in the `scss` file and refresh the page once more.


## Exercise 2

> ### Setup
> Modify `gulpfile.js` so that the `entryPath` variable points to:
> -  `01_Day_1/01_Sass_basics/02_Value_change_in_CSS`
>
> **Remember that after each change in `gulpfile.js` you should stop Gulp (`CTRL+C`) and run it again (`gulp`).**

Change header color and add a property, e.g. margin, directly in the generated `css` file. Check the changes in the browser. Go to the `scss` file and make any change other than the one you made in the `css` file, e.g. padding. Save the file and check the result both in the generated `css` file, and in the browser. What has changed?


## Exercise 3

> ### Setup
> Modify `gulpfile.js` so that the `entryPath` variable points to:
> -  `01_Day_1/01_Sass_basics/03_Variables`
>
> **Remember that after each change in `gulpfile.js` you should stop Gulp (`CTRL+C`) and run it again (`gulp`).**

In the `scss/main.scss` file, you have a piece of code with sample page styling.

Your task is to move some of the values to variables in the `_variables.scss` file.

Look at the code, create appropriate variables, and use them in the code of the `main.scss` file.

For example, one of the variables may be **div size**, or their **color**.
