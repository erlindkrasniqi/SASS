> ### Setup

> Modify `gulpfile.js` so that the `entryPath` variable points to:
>
> -  `01_Day_1/02_Nesting/01_Styling_with_nesting`
>
> **Remember that after each change in `gulpfile.js` you should stop Gulp (`CTRL+C`) and run it again (`gulp`).**

## Exercise 1 - done with the lecturer

Using parent selector `&` and appropriate nesting, find the first list element in an element with `main-width` class and change its color to red.

---

## Exercises to do on your own

### Exercise 2

- Define two variables with colors and a third one with width:
  - primary-color: cornflowerblue
  - accent-color: tomato
  - main-width: 1000px
- Style elements of a list with `menu` **class** so that they appear side by side, set their left padding to **10px**. Set background for the entire list. Choose the color from variables that you have defined.
- Set border for the **header**. element. Use colors that you have defined earlier.
- Style the **main-width**. element. Set site width to the value of the corresponding variable.

Remember to nest elements reasonably.

### Exercise 3

Create a list with five elements in one of the sections. Fill each element with text. Set the following:

- any element should change color to red on mouse hover,
- color of the first list element should be orange,
- color of the last list element should be green.

### Exercise 4

Style the list with navigation which you will find in the footer. Its elements should be displayed side by side and be aligned to the left.When mouse cursor hovers over an element, the list's color or background should change. Also, align the last element to the right.
